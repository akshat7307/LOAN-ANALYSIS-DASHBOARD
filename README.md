# LOAN-ANALYSIS-DASHBOARD

📊 Loan Analysis Dashboard – Excel Project

A detailed loan-based analytics dashboard built using Excel to analyze customer demographics, loan distribution trends, and interest-rate behavior.
This project helps banking and NBFC teams identify high-potential customer segments and design a more profitable loan strategy.

🔍 Project Objective

The bank intends to launch a new loan scheme but lacks clear understanding of the current customers and their borrowing patterns.
This project analyzes historical loan data to uncover:

✔ Customer segments most likely to adopt new loan schemes
✔ Loan categories with high demand
✔ Income vs loan size relationships
✔ Interest rate patterns based on credit score
✔ Borrower home-ownership & demographic influence

Medium-income and bachelor-educated users form the strongest target audience.
